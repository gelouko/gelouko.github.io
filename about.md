My real name is [Giulio Denardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdenardi/) and I've been working as a Software Engineer for around 5 years.


## My Career

I started as a developer in an e-commerce company, then went to a really nice tech company (Intuit) where I grew a LOT as an engineer and as a professional, and now I work for a bank in Brazil in the Public Cloud team, delivering delightful developer experiences for thousands of developers in the company.

## This Blog

Since my first steps in technology, I've always created new POCs, projects, and stuff that would help me solve problems that I had or had to solve. Looking back to the past, I realize that I spent a lot of time on projects that I didn't keep or share, and sometimes they would be really useful for other people.

So, this blog is all about this! I'll post a lot of projects, architectures and interesting stuff that I learn or do, in other to help other people with possible problems they face while adopting new technologies, etc. It's not a learning blog, but a blog to see applications for stuff that you probably already know.

## Need help?

If you'd like to see some architecture or project that you think is interesting, but you don't have time to implement it, send me a message and I'll gladly try to learn and post something on it! :)

Thanks for sparing some time to look at my content, and any [feedbacks are welcome](mailto:gelouko.me@gmail.com)!
