This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). If you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.

## Adventures on Cloud

Currently, I'm focused on creating cloud solutions and projects that will help bring developers and companies more performance, economy, and simplicity to their environments.

I'm also a big fan of open source, so one time or another you might see me posting a new issue or contributing to a repo :)

I'm commited to learn more about Docker and Kubernetes and bring more projects on it.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach me up! :)

## Won't lose my roots

Even though I'm focusing on stuff like Cloud, DevOps, etc. I'm still a Software Engineer, so I'm also keeping up with develompent best practices, modern frameworks, learning new languages, etc.

I love to have a broad view and knowledge on every part of the SDLC, so do expect to see some coding projects in the future!
